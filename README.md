### What I learned

During this project, I gained valuable experience in several key areas. Here are some of the most important lessons I learned:

1. Using APIs with async-await Methods
   One of the most crucial skills I acquired in this project was utilizing APIs and asynchronous functions to efficiently retrieve data. This allowed me to dynamically update information on the application and provide users with fresh data.

2. Theme Switching (Light/Dark mode)
   I learned how to implement a theme toggle for the application, allowing users to switch between light and dark modes. This is important for catering to users with different interface preference.

3. Utilizing Flexbox and Grid Styles
   I gained a deeper understanding of how to efficiently manage the layout of elements on a page using Flexbox and Grid styles. This enabled me to design responsive and visually appealing user interfaces.

4. Working with the SCSS Preprocessor
   I learned how to use SCSS to organize and enhance my styles. SCSS allowed me to utilize variables, nested styles, and many other advanced features.

These learned skills significantly enhanced my web development abilities.
